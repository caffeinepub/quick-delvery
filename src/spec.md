# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebrand the web app from “Quick-Delvery” to “QUICK-D” and swap in the new combined QUICK-D logo across the UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Update all user-facing frontend text occurrences of “Quick-Delvery” to “QUICK-D” (browser tab title, splash, auth, home header, footer copyright, out-of-radius messaging, and any other marketing/heading references).
- Add the new combined QUICK-D logo image to `frontend/public/assets/generated/` and update all logo usages to reference it instead of `/assets/generated/quick-delvery-logo.dim_512x512.png`.
- Update logo alt text to “QUICK-D” where applicable and ensure all logo paths resolve without broken images.

**User-visible outcome:** The app consistently displays the “QUICK-D” brand name throughout the UI and shows the new combined QUICK-D logo on splash, auth, and home screens.
