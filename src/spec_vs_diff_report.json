However, the diff summary does not show the new logo asset being added under `frontend/public/assets/generated`, and it’s not possible from the provided diff summary to confirm project-wide removal of all user-facing “Quick-Delvery” occurrences or that every instance of the old logo path was replaced everywhere.",
